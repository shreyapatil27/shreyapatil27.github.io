							<h1>Power BI Exercise Data Dashboard</h1>
							<p>This dataset contains information regarding daily exercise routines, detailing the types of 
								exercises performed and the corresponding durations for each activity.</p>
							<h3>GOAL</h3>
							<p>The goal is to create an interactive and visually engaging dashboard to analyze and present insights from the 
								daily exercise dataset to provide a comprehensive overview of exercise patterns, 
								types of activities undertaken, and their respective durations, for individuals to track, assess, 
								and optimize their fitness routines.</p>

							 <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
							 <p>This dashboard highlights a notable focus on running and walking activities in the exercise routine. 
								This concentration suggests a limited diversity in physical activities, potentially impacting overall fitness levels and 
								holistic well-being.<br>However, incorporating a variety of exercises such as strength training, flexibility exercises, 
								or different cardio activities can ensure a well-rounded fitness routine.<br>
								Also, Consideration of consulting with a fitness professional to create a personalized exercise plan that aligns with 
								individual goals can ensures better fitness.</p>
